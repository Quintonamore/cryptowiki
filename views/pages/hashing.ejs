<h2>
  Hashing
</h2>

<p>
  Hashing is the process of turning data of arbitrary size into data of fixed size.
  The values that are returned are called the hash values. Websites that have a user/password
  log-in system will store your password's hash value instead of the plaintext password itself. (At least they should!)
</p>
<p>
  Our hashing demonstration will show you what a hash value of plaintext you enter. We've also have a hash breaker, so you can see how secure your password is!
  Keep in mind that our hash breaking demo shouldn't be used as the end all test for password strength.
